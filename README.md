# benner_calculator
A perpetual calculator for Benner's financial cycles based on current year or user entered year.


# USE
This is a command line program, made for Linux but able to work on any python environment.

It accepts an argument as -y or --year and a number year, which will be used as the center year for calculation, if
there isn't a year provided, the program will use today's year.

You can use the flag -h or --help to view the flags.


# TO DO
- Ideally it will generate a graph with the cycles and years calculated, with matplotlib.
- Maybe the calculated years range must be shown from -56 to +56 years from the input year.
